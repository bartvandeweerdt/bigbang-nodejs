Leonard is an experimental physicist originally from New Jersey who shares an apartment with colleague and friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons). Leonard and Sheldon are named after actor/producer Sheldon Leonard, and Nobel Prize Laureates Robert Hofstadter and Leon Cooper. Leonard has been described as the straight man of the series. Penny (Kaley Cuoco) is Leonard's next-door neighbor and main love interest, and the teasing of romance between the two of them is a major force driving the series. For his portrayal, Galecki was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award.",

Penny is the primary female character on the show, befriending her across-the-hall neighbors Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), two physicists who work at the nearby California Institute of Technology (CalTech). Penny's lack of advanced education but outgoing personality and common sense drastically contrast with the personalities of the primary male characters in the series, even though she is considered part of their group. She is the love interest of Leonard, whom she dates regularly during the third, fifth and sixth seasons.",

The relationship has also been described by Leonard's mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, (Christine Baranski) as an \"ersatz homosexual marriage.\" Raj works as an astrophysicist in the Physics Department at Caltech. His principal characteristic is selective mutism which does not allow him to talk to women (outside of his family) unless under the influence of alcohol or believing that he consumed alcohol.",

        bio: "Sheldon Lee Cooper, M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D. is a fictional character on the CBS television series The Big Bang Theory, portrayed by actor Jim Parsons. For his portrayal, Parsons has won two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a TCA Award, and a Critics' Choice Television Award. Sheldon is a Caltech theoretical physicist who shares an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). Sheldon exhibits a strict adherence to routine, a total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm, and humor, and a general lack of humility or empathy. He is vocal about his own superior intellect compared to all around him. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Despite speculation that Sheldon's personality traits may be consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessiveâ€“compulsive personality disorder and asexuality; co-creator Bill Prady has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's character was not conceived nor developed with regard to any of these conditions.",
